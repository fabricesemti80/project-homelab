# Implementation Decisions

## Confirmed

-   Network: VLAN30 (`10.0.30.0/24`).
-   Access model: Tailscale for both node-level and subnet routing scenarios.
-   CNI: Cilium (target configuration enables kube-proxy replacement).
-   Ingress: the migrated cluster currently uses Envoy Gateway; Traefik remains only a historical design idea.
-   Storage: the migrated cluster currently uses Ceph CSI; Longhorn remains optional future work rather than current state.
-   GitOps: Argo CD.
-   Media service: remains on NAS Docker initially, routed via cluster ingress as external upstream.
-   Cluster relocation: keep the old `home-argo-cluster-2025` repo intact, but operate the migrated cluster directly from the `project-homelab` repo root with local state copied over.
-   Worker handling during cutover: keep worker VMs represented in Terraform state, but allow them to remain provisioned and powered off by using per-node `started = false`.

## Pending final user confirmation

-   Initial 5 application services to onboard after platform baseline.
-   RPO/RTO tier definitions for critical services.
