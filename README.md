# project-homelab

This repository is the main source of truth for the homelab. It manages:

-   the host-level Docker stack under `infra/docker/`
-   the imported Talos / Argo cluster workflow at the repo root
-   the OpenTofu stacks under `infra/terraform/` and `terraform/`

## Core Tasks

Ensure `mise` is installed, then:

```bash
mise install
mise run deps
```

Common workflows:

```bash
# Host-level Docker stack
mise run stack:deploy

# Both OpenTofu stacks
mise run tf:init
mise run tf:plan

# Talos / cluster bootstrap flow
mise run talos:genconfig
mise run talos:bootstrap
mise run apps:bootstrap
mise run verify:cluster
```

## Repository Notes

-   `kubernetes/` and `bootstrap/` are the active GitOps source for cluster apps.
-   `talos/`, `cluster.yaml`, and `nodes.yaml` are still part of the active Talos config-generation workflow.
-   Older placeholder folders were removed from Git where they no longer backed any active workflow.
